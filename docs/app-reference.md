# App Reference

Fast-orientation index for Claude. Read this at the start of any session before searching for files. It is not a replacement for `docs/schema/` — it is a map to where things live.

## Environments

| Name | Host | App path | Artisan |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Local (WSL2)** | `localhost` | `~/nonprofitcrm` (WSL2 Linux filesystem) | `docker compose exec app php artisan` |
| **Deploy server** | `root@167.172.141.225` (DigitalOcean, Ubuntu 22.04) | `/opt/nonprofitcrm` | `docker exec nonprofitcrm_app php artisan` |

### Deploy server — Docker containers

| Container name | Role |
|----------------|------|
| `nonprofitcrm_app` | PHP-FPM (Laravel app) |
| `nonprofitcrm_nginx` | Nginx reverse proxy |
| `nonprofitcrm_worker` | Queue worker |
| `nonprofitcrm_postgres` | PostgreSQL 16 |
| `nonprofitcrm_redis` | Redis (cache + queue) |

Local container names are identical. Local compose file: `docker-compose.yml` in the project root. Deploy server compose file: `/opt/nonprofitcrm/docker-compose.prod.yml`.

Deploy server domain: `beuscher.net`. `.env` lives at `/opt/nonprofitcrm/.env` (not in source control).

**`.env` propagation note:** `docker-compose.prod.yml` wires the host `.env` via `env_file:` (read at container *start*, not mounted as a live file), so edits to `/opt/nonprofitcrm/.env` do not reach the running container until you restart it (`docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` or `restart app worker`). `php artisan config:clear` only flushes the cached config file — it does not refresh the process environment. After restarting, run `config:clear` to drop any stale `bootstrap/cache/config.php` (the `bootstrap_cache` named volume persists across restarts). The `worker` container needs the same restart for queue jobs to see new env values.

## Build server — public asset pipeline

The public site's widget CSS and JS are compiled by an external build server. The admin panel CSS (Filament theme) stays on Vite.

### Connection

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Config key | `services.build_server.url` / `services.build_server.api_key` |
| Env vars | `BUILD_SERVER_URL`, `BUILD_SERVER_API_KEY` |
| Local dev URL | `http://bundleserver:8080` |
| Auth | Bearer token (API key) |

### Triggering a build

```bash
# Inside the app container:
docker compose exec app php artisan build:public

# With detailed error output:
docker compose exec app php artisan build:public --debug
```

The command calls `App\Services\AssetBuildService::build()`, which:

1. Collects all SCSS partials from `resources/scss/` (in dependency order) and widget CSS/JS from `widget_types` records
2. Generates content-hashed filenames (`public-widgets-{hash}.css/js`)
3. POSTs the sources to the build server with Bearer auth
4. Writes the compiled bundles to `public/build/widgets/`
5. Writes `public/build/widgets/manifest.json` with the current filenames
6. Cleans up old bundles

### Where bundles live

```
public/build/widgets/
├── manifest.json
├── public-widgets-{hash}.css
└── public-widgets-{hash}.js
```

### How the layout loads bundles

The public layout (`resources/views/layouts/public.blade.php`) reads `public/build/widgets/manifest.json` and renders a `<link>` tag for the CSS bundle and a `<script>` tag for the JS bundle. If the manifest doesn't exist (build server hasn't run), no bundle tags are rendered and the site works normally via Vite.

### Template custom SCSS

Per-template `custom_scss` is still compiled at runtime by ScssPhp and injected as an inline `<style>` block. This is separate from the build server pipeline and will move to the build server post-beta. Note: ScssPhp does not support Sass `@use` modules, so template custom SCSS must use plain SCSS or CSS custom properties (`var(--color-primary)`) — not `$variables`.

### Fallback when the build server is unavailable

The existing bundles in `public/build/widgets/` persist on disk. If the build server is unreachable, the `build:public` command fails with an error, but the site continues serving the last successful build.

## Backups

CRM data is backed up nightly to a per-install DigitalOcean Spaces bucket. The pipeline is `spatie/laravel-backup` invoked by the Laravel scheduler.

### What gets backed up

- The `nonprofitcrm` Postgres database (via `pg_dump`).
- The Spatie media library tree under `storage/app/public`.

### Per-install bucket setup procedure

Each install gets its own DigitalOcean Spaces bucket and its own scoped access key. Setup steps for a new install:

1. **Create a Space** (DO console → Spaces → Create) with a name like `nonprofitcrm-{install-handle}-backups`. Region should match the droplet's region for lowest latency.
2. **Generate a bucket-scoped Spaces access key** (DO console → API → Spaces Keys → Generate New Key, with the bucket scoped to the new bucket and permission `Read/Write/Delete`).
3. **Set production env vars** in the install's `/opt/nonprofitcrm/.env`:
   - `SPACES_KEY=<scoped key>`
   - `SPACES_SECRET=<scoped secret>`
   - `SPACES_BUCKET=<bucket name from step 1>`
   - `SPACES_REGION=<region slug, e.g. nyc3>`
   - `SPACES_ENDPOINT=https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com`
   - `BACKUP_DISKS=spaces`
4. **Restart the worker container** so the scheduler picks up the new env. The first scheduled `backup:run` (next 01:30 UTC) writes the first blob to the bucket and updates `storage/app/private/fleet/last-backup-at`.
5. **Verify** by hitting `/api/health` with a curl that presents the FM-supplied client cert after the first backup runs — `last_backup_at.status` should be `green` with a recent ISO timestamp. Auth is mTLS as of v2.0.0; see `docs/runbooks/fleet-manager-cert-paste.md` for the verification command.

### Local dev posture

Local dev defaults to `BACKUP_DISKS=local`, which writes backups to `storage/app/private/Laravel/`. No Spaces credentials are required to run `php artisan backup:run` locally for testing. Each manual run also writes `storage/app/private/fleet/last-backup-at`, so local `/api/health` responses reflect a green `last_backup_at` once a manual run has happened.

### Orphan media sweep

`spatie/laravel-medialibrary` ships `media-library:clean`, which removes orphan `media` rows (where the polymorphic owner is gone) and orphan conversion files (where the parent `media` row is gone but the conversion file lingers). Session 247 registered it in `bootstrap/app.php`'s `withSchedule()` block on a daily cadence (`->onOneServer()->withoutOverlapping()`). It does NOT walk the whole `storage/app/public/` tree looking for files with no `media` row — that wholesale-wipe gap remains open as a stub in `session-outlines.md` (the original 247 `app:reset` fix was reverted at session 252; see the stub for the open design question). Subject to the same scheduler-runner gap below.

### Scheduler runner — known gap

The `worker` service (both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`) runs `php artisan queue:work` only — no `schedule:work` and no cron-driven `schedule:run`. The 242 wiring registers `backup:clean` and `backup:run` in `bootstrap/app.php`'s `withSchedule()` block (visible via `php artisan schedule:list`), and 247 added `media-library:clean`, but none of them fire automatically until a scheduler runner is added (a separate worker variant, sidecar, or host-level cron). Manual `php artisan backup:run` works today; production deployment requires the runner to be in place before the daily cadence takes effect. Listed as a carry-forward in `sessions/tracks/fleet-manager-agent.md`.

### Restoration (manual)

`spatie/laravel-backup` does not ship restore tooling — restoration is a manual operator operation. The procedure was verified end-to-end against a local backup during session 242 manual testing (twice — once against the seeded baseline, once against a 99 MB backup with 48 admin-created contacts + 95 user-uploaded media; both round-tripped cleanly).

1. **Locate the backup blob.** On Spaces, download the most-recent zip from the install's bucket. Locally, zips live at `storage/app/private/{APP_NAME}/<timestamp>.zip`. Each zip contains `db-dumps/postgresql-{db_name}.sql.gz` (gzip-compressed plain SQL — `database_dump_compressor` is set to `Spatie\DbDumper\Compressors\GzipCompressor::class`) plus the included media tree under `storage/app/public/...` (paths are relative to `base_path()`).
2. **Wipe the target before restoring.** `docker compose exec app php artisan db:wipe --force` drops all tables, types, and views — cleaner than `migrate:fresh` since the dump's `CREATE TABLE` statements would otherwise conflict with the freshly-migrated empty tables. Also wipe the media tree for a clean restore: `rm -rf storage/app/public/*`.
3. **Extract the archive.** `unzip <backup>.zip -d /tmp/restore` (or any work directory).
4. **Restore the database.** `gunzip -c /tmp/restore/db-dumps/postgresql-<db_name>.sql.gz | PGPASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD> psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <db_name>`. The dump is gzip-compressed plain SQL — pipe through `gunzip -c` and stream into `psql`; `pg_restore` is for `pg_dump --format=custom` output, which we do not produce. The container's postgres requires a real password (configured in `docker-compose.yml` from `DB_PASSWORD`); set `PGPASSWORD` inline so the command does not stall on a silent password prompt.
5. **Restore media.** `cp -r /tmp/restore/storage/app/public/* /var/www/html/storage/app/public/`. The zip stores media at paths relative to `base_path()` (i.e. `storage/app/public/...`) because `relative_path` is set to `base_path()` in the spatie config.

The success-record file at `storage/app/private/fleet/last-backup-at` is **not** included in the backup zip — `source.files.include` is `storage/app/public` only. That is intentional: the success-record is per-install metadata about *this* install's backup history, not data to replicate onto another install. After a cross-install restore, the recipient's `last_backup_at` continues to reflect *their* most-recent local `backup:run`, which is the right answer.

Backup restoration is intentionally manual at v1 — high-stakes operations benefit from the operator pausing to verify each step rather than a click-button shortcut.

## Fleet Manager mTLS — cert paths

The Fleet Manager agent contract authenticates via mTLS at the TLS layer as of v2.0.0 (session 248). Nginx terminates the handshake; the application has no auth code path on `/api/health`. Two cert plumbing details matter operationally:

- **Local dev:** run `bin/dev-certs.sh` once per fresh checkout to generate `nginx-certs/localhost.{crt,key}` (the server-side TLS cert for `localhost`). Both files are gitignored. Without them, `docker compose up` fails because nginx cannot load the SSL config. The placeholder client-trust cert at `nginx-certs/fm-client.crt` is committed and untouched by the script.
- **Production:** the operator pastes the FM-supplied client cert into `/opt/nonprofitcrm/nginx-certs/fm-client.crt` (bind-mounted into the nginx container at `/etc/nginx/certs/fm-client.crt`) before first nginx start, and re-pastes plus restarts on rotation. Full procedure at `docs/runbooks/fleet-manager-cert-paste.md`.

The mTLS gate is `/api/health`-scoped only — public routes, admin, portal stay reachable without a client cert.

## Dev tooling — widget thumbnails

| Item | Path / command |
|------|----------------|
| Dev demo route (non-production only) | `GET /dev/widgets/{handle}` — `App\Http\Controllers\Dev\WidgetDemoController@show` |
| Dev preset variant route (non-production only) | `GET /dev/widgets/{handle}/presets/{presetHandle}` — `WidgetDemoController@showPreset` |
| Gate | `routes/dev.php` is conditionally required by `routes/web.php`; `App\Http\Middleware\DevRoutesMiddleware` enforces 404 in production |
| Widget manifest JSON command | `docker compose exec app php artisan widgets:manifest-json` |
| Thumbnail capture script (host-side) | `scripts/generate-thumbnails.js` — standalone Node, runs on the WSL2 host (not inside Docker). Supports `--widget=` and `--preset=` filters. |
| Host-level Playwright install | `npm install --global playwright && npx playwright install chromium` (not in `package.json`) |
| Thumbnail output | `app/Widgets/{PascalName}/thumbnails/static.png` and `preset-{handle}.png`, committed to the repo |
| Public thumbnail serving route | `GET /widget-thumbnails/{handle}/{file}` — `App\Http\Controllers\WidgetThumbnailController`. Strict filename regex (`static.png` / `preset-*.png`). |
